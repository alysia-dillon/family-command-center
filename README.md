# Family Command Center: A Task & Event Management Platform

This demo project is a task and event management system built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. It allows users to manage multiple people, tasks, and events with the following features:

- **Add People**: Create and manage a list of people.
- **Task Management**: Assign tasks to individuals with due dates. Tasks can be added, edited, and deleted.
- **Event Management**: Schedule events for individuals with a date and time. Events can be added, edited, and deleted.
- **Date & Time Formatting**: Uses `dayjs` for formatting dates and times, including military time converted to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS, the interface is clean and user-friendly.

This project demonstrates the use of **state management**, **form handling**, and **basic CRUD operations** in a real-world application.
